            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://timewonderlandmoney.github.io">Wonderland Time</a> acts as a read-only portal that connects to users'
                crypto wallets and the underlying DeFi protocols they interact with:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Users connect their wallet like MetaMask to Wonderland Time via wallet integration.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Wonderland Time then retrieves wallet activity history from the blockchain like transfers, approvals, and
                        interactions with protocols.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It integrates with supported DeFi protocols' APIs to sync activities like deposits, borrows,
                        yields from there.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>All this scattered data is then consolidated into a unified dashboard and analytics.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>No private keys or funds are held by Wonderland Time - it simply acts as an interface to view portfolio
                        holdings and activities.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This permissionless, non-custodial model makes it a safe platform for users to gain insights without
                privacy or security risks.</p>
            <h2>Importance of Portfolio Tracking</h2>
            <p>With the rise of DeFi, tracking one's crypto wealth and activities has become increasingly complex as
                users interact with several platforms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>DeFi protocols typically don't offer portfolio-level views.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Manual logging into each protocol is time-consuming.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Critical to track performance, yields, exposures across networked finance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Difficulties in tax reporting and compliance without centralized records.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Risks of forgotten funds or inactive protocols without tracking.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Aggregated portfolio tracking solutions like Wonderland Time have therefore become crucial for easier overviews,
                compliance, and ensuring users remain updated on their expanding investments in this burgeoning sector.
            </p>
            <h2>Risks of Using Wonderland Time</h2>
            <h3>While Wonderland Time provides valuable services, some risks do exist:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>API/syncing issues could lead to temporary data mismatches or delays.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Blockchain errors could impact syncing if transactions fail to record properly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Reliant on supported protocols - won't track wallets/exchanges without APIs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Users still need to monitor connected accounts/wallets for cyber threats.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Non-custodial means Wonderland Time isn't liable for funds if connected services are hacked.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Regulatory risks if user data is ever exposed or accessed without consent.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>UX/feature overhauls could impact syncing of historical data ported over.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Centralized service - single point of failure if Wonderland Time has outages or gets hacked.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To minimize such risks, responsible data policies, robust architectures and proactive safety measures are
                important for any portfolio tracking service provider.</p>
